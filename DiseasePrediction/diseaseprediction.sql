(1, 'Skipping breakfast and fasting may compromise the immune system', 'Breakfast is popularly known as “the most important meal of the day”, but scientific research into the health effects of skipping breakfast remains inconclusive.\r\nConfusingly, a large number of studies have found that regular daytime fasting — such as limiting meals to a narrow window of time or “time-restricted feeding” — has several health benefits.\r\n'),
(2, 'Could a monthly antibody injection be a promising endometriosis treatment?', 'According to the World Health Organization Trusted Source (WHO), endometriosis affects around 10% of people who menstruate, some 190 million people globally.\r\nSymptoms, including severe pain during menstruation, heavy menstrual bleeding, back and pelvic pain, pain during intercourse, and, in some people, problems with fertility, occur when tissue similar to the endometrium, or uterine lining, grows outside the uterus.\r\n'),
(3, 'Purple vegetables and tubers may have superior anti-diabetic properties', 'According to the CDC, over 37 million Americans—about 1 in 10Trusted Source individuals—have diabetes, and approximately 90-95% of them have type 2 diabetes.\r\nNormally, a hormone called insulin moves glucose (sugar) from the blood into cells, where it’s used for energy. But in type 2 diabetes, the body doesn’t use or produce insulin properly, and glucose builds up in the blood instead of being used by cells.\r\n'),
(4, 'Blood biomarker may enable early diagnosis of vascular dementia', 'Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, and the one that most people are aware of. It causes some 70% of dementia cases.\r\nOther forms include Lewy body dementiaTrusted Source and vascular dementia. And it can be hard for physicians to tell the different types of dementia apart.\r\nOne major cause of cognitive decline and dementia in older people is cerebral small vessel disease Trusted Source. This results in decreased blood flow to key areas of the brain and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier Trusted Source.\r\n'),
(5, 'What is DNA and how does it impact health?', 'Virtually every cell in the body contains deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). It is the genetic code that makes each person unique. DNA carries the instructions for the development, growth, reproduction, and functioning of all life.\r\nDifferences in the genetic code are why one person has blue eyes rather than brown, why birds only have two wings, or why giraffes have long necks. Differences or mutations in the genetic code can also lead to being susceptible to certain diseases.\r\n'),
(6, 'What to know about the stomach and other digestive organs?', 'The digestion process is interdependent and a problem with one organ may disrupt the function of another. For example, gallstones can block the bile duct, affecting liver function. They may also block the pancreatic duct, causing pancreatitis and severe illness.\r\nIssues with the digestive organs can include pain, weight gain or loss, digestive problems, fever, and jaundice.\r\n'),
(7, 'The link between hyperglycemia and diabetes', 'When a person eats carbohydrates, the body breaks them down into simple sugars that enter the bloodstream. Once this occurs, the pancreas releases insulin.\r\nInsulin is a hormone that allows the body’s cells to absorb and use sugars from the blood for producing energy.\r\nWhen the body does not make any or enough insulin, or when the cells are unable to use the insulin correctly, blood sugar levels increase.\r\nIn this article, we look at the relationship between hyperglycemia and diabetes.\r\n'),
(8, 'Rare Disease Day 2023 - History', 'The day was created in 2008 by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases to increase public awareness of illnesses that go undiagnosed or untreated. That organization claims that while there are numerous days devoted to people with specific diseases (such as AIDS, cancer, etc.), there had not previously been a day for representing those affected by rare diseases. Additionally, the organization claims that social networks to support people with rare diseases and their families are inadequate. The National Organization for Rare Disorders organized 200 patient advocacy groups for rare diseases in the United States in 2009, and organizations in China, Australia, Taiwan, and Latin America also spearheaded efforts to coordinate events and publicize the day in their respective nations.\r\n'),
(9, 'Acanthocytosis Chorea', 'Chorea-acanthocytosis, also called choreoacanthocytosis is a rare hereditary disease caused by a mutation in a gene that directs structural proteins in red blood cells. The rare disease leads to effects like epilepsy, behavioral changes, muscle degeneration, and neuronal degradation similar to Huntington’s disease. The average age of onset of symptoms is 35 years. The disease is incurable and inevitably leads to premature death.\r\n'),
(10, 'Addison’s Disease', 'Addison’s disease, or hypercortisolism is a rare disorder which occurs due to the insufficient production of the steroid hormones-aldosterone and cortisol by the outer two layers of cells present in the adrenal gland. This disease can affect all age groups and both sexes. Around 40-60 people per million of the population are known to be affected by this disease. In India, it is known to affect 1 in 100,000 people.\r\n'),
(11, 'Angelman Syndrome', 'It is a rare genetic neuro-developmental disorder characterised by severe developmental delay, sleep disorders, jerky movements and frequent laughter. The syndrome is caused by an abnormality in a region of chromosome 15 and it’s usually not recognized at birth. AS is typically diagnosed between the ages of 3 and 7. The main characteristics of this syndrome are delayed motor skills, minimal or absence of speech, developmental delay, ataxia (shaky and unsteady movements), seizures, constant happy behavior that includes frequent laughing, smiling and excitability.\r\n'),
(12, 'Any Level of Physical Activity Tied to Better Later-Life Memory', 'Any amount of exercise in middle age is associated with better cognition in later life, new research suggests.\r\nA prospective study of 1400 participants showed that those who exercised to any extent in adulthood had significantly better cognitive scores later in life compared with their peers who were physically inactive.\r\n'),
(13, 'Modified ECT Lowers Dental, Skeletal Fracture Risk', 'Modified electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can reduce the risk for skeletal and dental fractures, new research shows.\r\n“ECT is associated with a very low risk of skeletal fractures, even in high-risk patients, and is also associated with a low risk of dental fractures,” said study investigator Chittaranjan Andrade, MD, noting that preexisting bone and dental disease increase this risk.\r\n'),
(14, 'Swallow This - Tiny Tech Tracks the Gut in Real Time', 'Part of what makes gastrointestinal troubles so frustrating – besides the frequent flights to the bathroom – are the invasive and uncomfortable tests one must endure for diagnosis, such as endoscopy or X-rays that can involve higher radiation exposure.\r\nBut a revolutionary new option promising greater comfort and convenience could become available within the next few years.\r\n'),
(15, 'FDA Declines Approval for Omecamtiv Mecarbil in HFrEF', 'The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has declined to approve omecamtiv mecarbil (Cytokinetics) for treatment of adults with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), citing a lack of evidence on efficacy.\r\nOmecamtiv mecarbil is a first-in-class, selective cardiac myosin activator designed to improve cardiac performance.\r\n'),

Most of them have been seen in men who have sex with men, but a small number have also occurred in women and in young children.\r\n'),
(17, 'Which Nonopioid Meds Are Best for Easing Acute Low Back Pain?', 'Muscle relaxants and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively improved symptoms of acute low back pain after 1 week of treatment, based on data from more than 3000 individuals.\r\nAcute low back pain (LBP) remains a common cause of disability worldwide, with a high socioeconomic burden, write Alice Baroncini, MD, of RWTH University Hospital, Aachen, Germany, and colleagues.\r\nIn an analysis published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Research, a team of investigators from Germany examined which nonopioid drugs are best for treating LBP.\r\n'),
(18, 'Empathy Meltdown? Why Burnout Busts Your Empathy Levels?', 'Compassion is borne out of a sense of empathy — the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Studies on empathy show it to be crucial to quality healthcare and not just for patients.\r\nIn one study on empathy ratings among doctors, 87% of the public believe that compassion, or a clear and obvious desire to relieve suffering, is the most critical factor when choosing a doctor. In fact, it eclipses travel time, wait time, and cost on the list of sought-after physician features.\r\n');

INSERT INTO `treatment` (`sno`, `disease`, `treat`) VALUES
(1, 'GERD', 'What is GERD?\r\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid repeatedly flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus.\r\n                             \r\nTREATMENT:\r\nYour doctor may recommend that you make lifestyle changes and take medicines to manage symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In some cases, doctors may also recommend surgery.\r\n\r\nAntacids: Doctors may recommend antacids to relieve mild heartburn and other mild GER and GERD symptoms. Antacids are available over the counter. Antacids can help relieve mild symptoms. However, you shouldn’t use these medicines every day or for severe symptoms, except after discussing your antacid use with your doctor. These medicines can have side effects, such as diarrhea or constipation.\r\n\r\nH2 Blockers: H2 blockers lower the amount of acid your stomach makes. H2 blockers can help heal the esophagus, but not as well as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can. You can buy H2 blockers over the counter, or your doctor can prescribe one.\r\n\r\nProton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs): PPIs lower the amount of acid your stomach makes. PPIs are better at treating GERD symptoms than H2 blockers, and they can heal the esophageal lining in most people with GERD. You can buy PPIs over the counter, or your doctor can prescribe one. Doctors may prescribe PPIs for long-term GERD treatment.\r\n'),
(2, 'Fungal Infection', 'What is Fungal Infection?\r\nA fungal infection, also called mycosis, is a skin disease caused by a fungus.\r\n\r\nThere are millions of species of fungi. They live in the dirt, on plants, on household surfaces, and on your skin. Sometimes, they can lead to skin problems like rashes or bumps.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nTreatment for skin fungus includes:\r\nAntifungal creams, many of which are available over-the-counter.\r\nStronger prescription medications, which may work faster.\r\nOral medicines, if the fungal infection is severe.\r\n\r\nCan I treat a fungal rash at home?\r\nIt’s important for your healthcare provider to see the rash, especially if this is the first time the rash has appeared. Your provider can diagnose it and discuss the best course of action to treat it. Treating a fungal rash with an anti-itch cream that contains a steroid may make the infection worse and more difficult to treat.\r\n\r\nGood foot hygiene\r\n\r\nChange your socks and wash your feet regularly. Avoid shoes made of plastic, which doesn’t breathe.\r\nDon’t walk barefoot, especially in places that may be wet, such as gym showers and locker rooms.\r\nWhen cutting your toenails, cut straight across the nail. If you have an ingrown toenail, you may need to see a podiatrist to care for it. And if you have a fungal nail infection, don’t use the same nail clippers on healthy nails and infected nails.\r\nProper medicine use\r\n\r\nIf your healthcare provider prescribed a cream (or advised you to use an over-the-counter cream), use the medicine as long as directed. Even after you can no longer see the rash, the fungal infection may still be there, so keep applying the cream as long as your provider recommends.\r\nYour healthcare provider may recommend the same course of treatment for all the members of your family. Often, people living together can pass an infection back and forth. Treating everyone will help make sure the infection is truly gone.\r\nTalk to your healthcare provider about whether you should use an antifungal cream regularly on your feet and nails to help prevent infections.\r\nUsing antifungal powder in your shoes every day may help prevent athlete’s foot.\r\n'),
(3, 'Allergy', 'What is Allergy?\r\nAllergy occurs when a person reacts to substances in the environment that are harmless to most people. These substances are known as allergens and are found in dust mites, pets, pollen, insects, ticks, moulds, foods and some medications.\r\n\r\nAtopy is the genetic tendency to develop allergic diseases. When atopic people are exposed to allergens they can develop an immune reaction that leads to allergic inflammation. This can cause symptoms in the:\r\n\r\nNose and/or eyes, resulting in allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and/or conjunctivitis.\r\nSkin resulting in eczema, or hives (urticaria).\r\nLungs resulting in asthma.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAllergy treatments include:\r\n\r\nAllergen avoidance. Your provider will help you take steps to identify and avoid your allergy triggers. This is generally the most important step in preventing allergic reactions and reducing symptoms.\r\nMedications. Depending on your allergy, medications can help reduce your immune system reaction and ease symptoms. Your provider might suggest nonprescription or prescription medication in the form of pills or liquid, nasal sprays, or eyedrops.\r\nImmunotherapy. For severe allergies or allergies not completely relieved by other treatment, your provider might recommend allergen immunotherapy. This treatment involves a series of injections of purified allergen extracts, usually given over a period of a few years.\r\n\r\nAnother form of immunotherapy is a tablet that\'s placed under the tongue (sublingual) until it dissolves. Sublingual drugs are used to treat some pollen allergies.\r\n\r\nEmergency epinephrine. If you have a severe allergy, you might need to carry an emergency epinephrine shot at all times. Given for severe allergic reactions, an epinephrine shot (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, others) can reduce symptoms until you get emergency treatment.\r\n'),
(4, 'Chronic Cholestasis', 'What is Chronic Cholestasis?\r\nCholestasis is the slowing or stalling of bile flow from your liver. Your liver produces bile and delivers it to your digestive system through a network of vessels called bile ducts. Bile ducts run through your liver (intrahepatic ducts) as well as outside of it (extrahepatic ducts). They connect your liver, gallbladder, pancreas and small intestine. These organs and bile ducts make up your biliary system.\r\n\r\nWhen bile can’t flow properly through your biliary system, it affects all of these organs and vessels. Bile backs up in your bile ducts and organs, irritating the tissues and interfering with their function. Bile also begins to leak into your bloodstream, which has a toxic effect. It causes uncomfortable symptoms, and eventually, illness. Cholestasis can be a temporary problem or an ongoing and worsening one.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAcute causes\r\n\r\nFixing cholestasis depends on fixing the underlying cause. Some causes are relatively easy to fix. Medications causing problems can be swapped for alternatives. Infections can be treated with antibiotics or antivirals. Physical obstructions can be treated by endoscopic procedures, such as ERCP. Your healthcare provider can remove blockages and open up narrowed passageways with stents.\r\n\r\nChronic causes\r\n\r\nCauses related to chronic liver diseases may be more difficult to treat. Some diseases have no known cure, and scarring of the liver tissues (cirrhosis) isn’t reversible. Lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise and avoiding alcohol, can help slow the course of many liver diseases. In the meantime, your healthcare provider will focus on treating the side effects of your condition.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include:\r\nNutrition. Dietary changes and supplements can help compensate for malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies.\r\nUrsodeoxycholic acid. This medication, which is usually used to dissolve gallstones, can sometimes help cholestasis by increasing bile production and mediating the effects of extra bile salts in your blood.\r\nNaltrexone. This opioid antagonist is sometimes prescribed to treat severe pruritus. It works by blocking the pathways to the nerves that are irritated by bile acids in your blood. Pruritus isn’t a histamine-related itch, so typical itching relief medications (antihistamines) don’t help.\r\nCholestyramine. This cholesterol medication can help bind cholesterol to bile salts in your intestines so that more comes out in your poop and less is reabsorbed into your blood. It may help with hyperlipidemia and with pruritus.'),
(5, 'Drug Reaction', 'What is Drug Reaction?\r\nA drug interaction is a reaction between two (or more) drugs or between a drug and a food, beverage, or supplement. Taking a drug while having certain medical conditions can also cause a drug interaction. For example, taking a nasal decongestant if you have high blood pressure may cause an unwanted reaction.\r\nA drug interaction can affect how a drug works or cause unwanted side effects.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nInterventions for a drug allergy can be divided into two general strategies:\r\n\r\nTreatment for present allergy symptoms\r\nTreatment that may enable you to take an allergy-causing drug if it\'s medically necessary\r\nTreating current symptoms\r\nThe following interventions may be used to treat an allergic reaction to a drug:\r\n\r\nWithdrawal of the drug. If your provider determines that you have a drug allergy — or likely allergy — discontinuing the drug is the first step in treatment. In many cases, this may be the only intervention necessary.\r\nAntihistamines. Your provider may prescribe an antihistamine or recommend a nonprescription antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl). An antihistamine can block immune system chemicals triggered during an allergic reaction.\r\nCorticosteroids. Either oral or injected corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammation associated with more-serious reactions.\r\nTreatment of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires an immediate epinephrine injection. Hospital care also is necessary to maintain blood pressure and support breathing.\r\nTaking allergy-causing drugs\r\nIf you have a confirmed drug allergy, your provider likely would not prescribe the drug unless it is necessary. In some cases — if the diagnosis of drug allergy is uncertain or there\'s no alternative treatment — your provider may use one of two strategies to use the suspect drug.\r\n\r\nWith either strategy, your provider provides careful supervision. Supportive care also is available in the event of an adverse reaction. These interventions are generally not used if drugs have caused severe, life-threatening reactions in the past.\r\n\r\nGraded challenge\r\nIf the diagnosis of a drug allergy is uncertain and your provider judges that an allergy is unlikely, a graded drug challenge may be an option. With this procedure, you receive 2 to 5 doses of the drug, starting with a small dose and increasing to the desired dose.\r\n\r\nIf you reach the therapeutic dose with no reaction, then your provider may recommend that you take the drug as prescribed.\r\n\r\nDrug desensitization\r\nIf it\'s necessary for you to take a drug that has caused an allergic reaction, your provider may recommend a treatment called drug desensitization. With this treatment, you receive a very small dose and then progressively larger doses every 15 to 30 minutes over several hours or days. If you can reach the desired dosage with no reaction, then you can continue the treatment.\r\n'),
(6, 'Peptic Ulcer Disease', 'What is Peptic Ulcer Disease?\r\nPeptic ulcer disease is characterized by discontinuation in the inner lining of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because of gastric acid secretion or pepsin. It extends into the muscularis propria layer of the gastric epithelium. It usually occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum. It may involve the lower esophagus, distal duodenum, or jejunum. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of peptic ulcer disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nTreatment for peptic ulcers depends on the cause. Usually treatment will involve killing the H. pylori bacterium if present, eliminating or reducing use of NSAIDs if possible, and helping your ulcer to heal with medication.\r\n\r\nMedications can include:\r\n\r\nAntibiotic medications to kill H. pylori. If H. pylori is found in your digestive tract, your doctor may recommend a combination of antibiotics to kill the bacterium. These may include amoxicillin (Amoxil), clarithromycin (Biaxin), metronidazole (Flagyl), tinidazole (Tindamax), tetracycline and levofloxacin.\r\n\r\nThe antibiotics used will be determined by where you live and current antibiotic resistance rates. You\'ll likely need to take antibiotics for two weeks, as well as additional medications to reduce stomach acid, including a proton pump inhibitor and possibly bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol).\r\n\r\nMedications that block acid production and promote healing. Proton pump inhibitors — also called PPIs — reduce stomach acid by blocking the action of the parts of cells that produce acid. These drugs include the prescription and over-the-counter medications omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid), rabeprazole (Aciphex), esomeprazole (Nexium) and pantoprazole (Protonix).\r\n\r\nLong-term use of proton pump inhibitors, particularly at high doses, may increase your risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture. Ask your doctor whether a calcium supplement may reduce this risk.\r\n\r\nMedications to reduce acid production. Acid blockers — also called histamine (H-2) blockers — reduce the amount of stomach acid released into your digestive tract, which relieves ulcer pain and encourages healing.\r\n\r\nAvailable by prescription or over the counter, acid blockers include the medications famotidine (Pepcid AC), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) and nizatidine (Axid AR).\r\n\r\nAntacids that neutralize stomach acid. Your doctor may include an antacid in your drug regimen. Antacids neutralize existing stomach acid and can provide rapid pain relief. Side effects can include constipation or diarrhea, depending on the main ingredients.\r\n\r\nAntacids can provide symptom relief but generally aren\'t used to heal your ulcer.\r\n\r\nMedications that protect the lining of your stomach and small intestine. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe medications called cytoprotective agents that help protect the tissues that line your stomach and small intestine.\r\n\r\nOptions include the prescription medications sucralfate (Carafate) and misoprostol (Cytotec).\r\n'),
(7, 'Diabetes ', 'What is Diabetes?\r\nDiabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.\r\n\r\nOver time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.\r\n\r\nSometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes.” These terms suggest that someone doesn’t really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nDiabetes is a complex condition, so its management involves several strategies. In addition, diabetes affects everyone differently, so management plans are highly individualized.\r\n\r\nThe four main aspects of managing diabetes include:\r\n\r\nBlood sugar monitoring: Monitoring your blood sugar (glucose) is key to determining how well your current treatment plan is working. It gives you information on how to manage your diabetes on a daily — and sometimes even hourly — basis. You can monitor your levels with frequent checks with a glucose meter and finger stick and/or with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You and your healthcare provider will determine the best blood sugar range for you.\r\nOral diabetes medications: Oral diabetes medications (taken by mouth) help manage blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes but still produce some insulin — mainly people with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. People with gestational diabetes may also need oral medication. There are several different types. Metformin is the most common.\r\nInsulin: People with Type 1 diabetes need to inject synthetic insulin to live and manage diabetes. Some people with Type 2 diabetes also require insulin. There are several different types of synthetic insulin. They each start to work at different speeds and last in your body for different lengths of time. The four main ways you can take insulin include injectable insulin with a syringe (shot), insulin pens, insulin pumps and rapid-acting inhaled insulin.\r\nDiet: Meal planning and choosing a healthy diet for you are key aspects of diabetes management, as food greatly impacts blood sugar. If you take insulin, counting carbs in the food and drinks you consume is a large part of management. The amount of carbs you eat determines how much insulin you need at meals. Healthy eating habits can also help you manage your weight and reduce your heart disease risk.\r\nExercise: Physical activity increases insulin sensitivity (and helps reduce insulin resistance), so regular exercise is an important part of management for all people with diabetes.\r\nDue to the increased risk for heart disease, it’s also important to maintain a healthy:\r\n\r\nWeight.\r\nBlood pressure.\r\nCholesterol.\r\n'),
(8, 'Gastroenteritis', 'What is Gastroenteritis?\r\nGastroenteritis is commonly called “stomach flu.” But it’s actually not caused by influenza, the respiratory virus that causes flu. Different stomach bugs (germs) are usually to blame for symptoms like diarrhea, stomach pain and feeling sick to your stomach.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nThe most important things you can do to feel better faster are rest and staying well hydrated. Between diarrhea and vomiting, your body loses a lot of water and electrolytes. If your belly is still upset, you can take small, frequent sips of water, sports drinks, juice or broth, or chew on ice chips. It is important to know that water alone may not be enough to keep you hydrated in severe cases of diarrhea so make sure to take in electrolyte balance hydration (sports drinks, Gatorade®, Pedialyte®, etc). Eat a normal diet when you feel hungry again.\r\n\r\nSince stomach flu can be caused by multiple factors, getting the flu vaccination alone isn’t enough to protect you from gastroenteritis. Children should follow the standard vaccination schedule and get the rotavirus vaccination when indicated. This vaccination can protect your child from getting sick from the rotovirus but not all children can receive this oral vaccination, so please check with your pediatrician before doing so.\r\n\r\nYou can take other steps to reduce your risk of getting stomach flu:\r\n\r\nPractice good handwashing\r\n\r\nWhen you’re sick, the virus spreads from anything that comes in contact with virus-infected feces. Good handwashing is vital in stopping the spread. Viruses left on hands can easily spread to surfaces, food and people you touch. It’s important to wash your hands well after you go to the bathroom, change a diaper, touch any bathroom surfaces and before you handle food.\r\n\r\nBe careful with food\r\n\r\nYou can catch stomach flu from contaminated food or water, or pass it on to someone else. To keep viruses out of your food:\r\n\r\nClean kitchen surfaces with a disinfectant (cleaner that kills germs), especially when working with raw meat or eggs.\r\nKeep raw meat, eggs and poultry away from foods that are eaten raw.\r\nAvoid eating raw or undercooked meat, eggs and shellfish.\r\nConsume only pasteurized dairy products and apple juice. Pasteurization is a heating process that kills germs.\r\nRinse fruits and vegetables before eating.\r\nDrink bottled water and avoid ice cubes when traveling, especially in developing countries. Unfamiliar germs that live in the water can make you sick.\r\nStop making food for others when you’re sick and for two days after symptoms are gone.\r\nClean sick areas\r\nClean anything that you may have touched while you were sick with stomach flu. Wash laundry with hot water and dry with high heat. Be sure to use a disinfectant to clean areas where a sick person vomited or had diarrhea.\r\n\r\n'),
(9, 'Bronchial Asthma', 'What is Bronchial Asthma?\r\nAsthma, also called bronchial asthma, is a disease that affects your lungs. It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management.\r\n\r\nAsthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nYou have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include:\r\n\r\nBronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma.\r\nAnti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma.\r\nBiologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy.\r\nYou can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow.\r\n\r\nWhat is asthma control?\r\nThe goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you:\r\n\r\nCan do the things you want to do at work and home.\r\nHave no (or minimal) asthma symptoms.\r\nRarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler).\r\nSleep without asthma interrupting your rest.\r\nHow do you monitor asthma symptoms?\r\nYou should keep track of your asthma symptom. It’s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.\r\n'),
(10, 'Hypertension ', 'What is Hypertension?\r\nHypertension (high blood pressure) is when the pressure in your blood vessels is too high (140/90 mmHg or higher). It is common but can be serious if not treated.\r\n\r\nPeople with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms. The only way to know is to get your blood pressure checked.\r\n\r\nThings that increase the risk of having high blood pressure include:\r\n\r\nOlder age \r\nGenetics\r\nBeing overweight or obese\r\nNot being physically active \r\nHigh salt diet\r\nDrinking too much alcohol\r\nLifestyle changes like eating a healthier diet, quitting tobacco and being more active can help lower blood pressure. Some people may still need to take medicines.\r\n\r\nBlood pressure is written as two numbers. The first (systolic) number represents the pressure in blood vessels when the heart contracts or beats. The second (diastolic) number represents the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests between beats.\r\n\r\nHypertension is diagnosed if, when it is measured on two different days, the systolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥140 mmHg and/or the diastolic blood pressure readings on both days is ≥90 mmHg.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nChanging your lifestyle can help control and manage high blood pressure. Your health care provider may recommend that you make lifestyle changes including:\r\n\r\nEating a heart-healthy diet with less salt\r\nGetting regular physical activity\r\nMaintaining a healthy weight or losing weight\r\nLimiting alcohol\r\nNot smoking\r\nGetting 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily\r\nSometimes lifestyle changes aren\'t enough to treat high blood pressure. If they don\'t help, your provider may recommend medicine to lower your blood pressure.\r\n\r\nMedications\r\nThe type of medicine used to treat hypertension depends on your overall health and how high your blood pressure is. Two or more blood pressure drugs often work better than one. It can take some time to find the medicine or combination of medicines that works best for you.\r\n\r\nWhen taking blood pressure medicine, it\'s important to know your goal blood pressure level. You should aim for a blood pressure treatment goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg if:\r\n\r\nYou\'re a healthy adult age 65 or older\r\nYou\'re a healthy adult younger than age 65 with a 10% or higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next 10 years\r\nYou have chronic kidney disease, diabetes or coronary artery disease\r\nThe ideal blood pressure goal can vary with age and health conditions, particularly if you\'re older than age 65.\r\n\r\nMedicines used to treat high blood pressure include:\r\n\r\nWater pills (diuretics). These drugs help remove sodium and water from the body. They are often the first medicines used to treat high blood pressure.\r\n\r\nThere are different classes of diuretics, including thiazide, loop and potassium sparing. Which one your provider recommends depends on your blood pressure measurements and other health conditions, such as kidney disease or heart failure. Diuretics commonly used to treat blood pressure include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide) and others.\r\n\r\nA common side effect of diuretics is increased urination. Urinating a lot can reduce potassium levels. A good balance of potassium is necessary to help the heart beat correctly. If you have low potassium (hypokalemia), your provider may recommend a potassium-sparing diuretic that contains triamterene.\r\n\r\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. These drugs help relax blood vessels. They block the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. Examples include lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril and others.\r\nAngiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These drugs also relax blood vessels. They block the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others.\r\nCalcium channel blockers. These drugs help relax the muscles of the blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others. Calcium channel blockers may work better for older people and Black people than do ACE inhibitors alone.\r\n\r\nDon\'t eat or drink grapefruit products when taking calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit increases blood levels of certain calcium channel blockers, which can be dangerous. Talk to your provider or pharmacist if you\'re concerned about interactions.\r\n'),
(11, 'Migraine', 'What is Migraine?\r\nMigraine is a neurological condition that is characterized by recurring episodes of moderate to severe headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms such as sensitivity to light, sound, or smells, nausea, and vomiting. Migraines typically last between 4 and 72 hours and can be debilitating, affecting a person\'s ability to carry out daily activities.\r\nMigraines are caused by changes in the brain and surrounding blood vessels. While the exact causes of migraines are not fully understood, it is believed that genetics, environmental factors, and certain triggers such as stress, certain foods, and hormonal changes can contribute to the development of migraines.\r\nThere are several types of migraines, including migraine with aura (where a person experiences visual or other sensory disturbances before the headache), migraine without aura, chronic migraines (where a person experiences headaches for more than 15 days a month), and menstrual migraines (which are triggered by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle).\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nTreatment for migraines typically involves a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and avoiding triggers.'),
(12, 'Cervical Spondylosis', 'What is Cervical Spondylosis?\r\nCervical spondylosis is a degenerative condition that affects the joints and discs in the neck region of the spine.

Surgical options may include cervical laminectomy, cervical fusion, or cervical disc replacement.\r\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for cervical spondylosis.\r\n'),
(13, 'Paralysis (Brain Hem', 'What is Paralysis (Brain Hemorrhage)?\r\nParalysis caused by brain hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the brain that damages the area responsible for movement control. The severity of paralysis depends on the location and extent of the hemorrhage. Paralysis can affect one side of the body (hemiplegia) or both sides of the body (quadriplegia).\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nTreatment for paralysis caused by brain hemorrhage involves stabilizing the patient\'s condition and addressing the underlying cause of the hemorrhage. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the blood clot and relieve pressure on the brain.\r\nRehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process and can involve physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Physical therapy can help improve strength, mobility, and coordination. Occupational therapy can help patients learn how to perform daily activities with limited mobility. Speech therapy can help patients who have difficulty speaking or swallowing.\r\nMedications may also be prescribed to help manage pain, prevent blood clots, and reduce inflammation. In some cases, patients may require long-term care, such as nursing care, to help manage their condition.\r\nIt is important for patients with paralysis caused by brain hemorrhage to have regular follow-up appointments with their healthcare provider to monitor their condition and adjust their treatment plan as needed.\r\n'),
(14, 'Jaundice', 'What is Jaundice?\r\nJaundice is a condition that occurs when there is a buildup of bilirubin in the body, leading to yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. Bilirubin is a waste product produced by the breakdown of red blood cells.\r\nThe causes of jaundice can vary and include liver disease, infections, blockages of the bile ducts, and certain medications.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nTreatment for jaundice depends on the underlying cause. For example, if the jaundice is caused by an infection, antibiotics may be prescribed to treat the infection. If the jaundice is caused by a blockage in the bile ducts, surgery may be necessary to remove the blockage.\r\nIn cases of severe jaundice, hospitalization may be necessary for close monitoring and treatment. Phototherapy, which involves exposing the skin to a special type of light, can be used to help reduce bilirubin levels in newborns with jaundice.\r\nIn addition to treating the underlying cause of jaundice, supportive care may be necessary to help manage symptoms. This may include rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding alcohol and certain medications that can worsen liver function.\r\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for jaundice.\r\n'),

Staying hydrated: Drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or soup, can help relieve congestion and prevent dehydration.\r\n3. Using over-the-counter medications: Medications such as decongestants, pain relievers, and cough suppressants can help relieve symptoms.\r\n4. Using saline nasal sprays or drops: These can help alleviate nasal congestion and reduce the risk of secondary infections.\r\n5. Gargling with salt water: This can help soothe a sore throat.\r\n6. Using a humidifier: Adding moisture to the air can help relieve congestion and coughing.\r\nIt is important to note that antibiotics are not effective against the common cold, as it is caused by a virus rather than bacteria. If symptoms persist or worsen, or if you develop a high fever or difficulty breathing, it is important to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\r\n'),
(27, 'Pneumonia', 'What is Pneumonia ?\r\nPneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid \r\nor pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A \r\nvariety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nMost people begin to feel better after one to three days of antibiotic treatment. However, you should \r\ntake antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. If you stop too soon, your pneumonia may come back. The \r\nprescribed medicines are First-line antibiotics that might be selected include the macrolide antibiotics \r\nazithromycin (Zithromax) or clarithromycin (Biaxin XL), or the tetracycline known as doxycycline.'),
(28, 'Dimorphic Hemmorhoid', 'What is Dimorphix Hemmorhoids(Piles) ?\r\nHemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in your anus and lower rectum, similar \r\nto varicose veins. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum (internal hemorrhoids) or under the skin \r\naround the anus (external hemorrhoids).Nearly three out of four adults will have hemorrhoids from time \r\nto time. Hemorrhoids have a number of causes, but often the cause is unknown. Fortunately, effective \r\noptions are available to treat hemorrhoids. Many people get relief with home treatments and lifestyle \r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAdd more fiber to your diet from food, a fiber supplement (such as Metamucil, Citrucel, or Fiber Con), or \r\nboth. Along with adequate fluid, fiber softens stools and makes them easier to pass, reducing pressure \r\non hemorrhoids. High-fiber foods include broccoli, beans, wheat and oat bran, whole-grain foods, and \r\nfresh fruit. When you feel the urge to defecate, go to the bathroom immediately; don\'t wait until a more \r\nconvenient time. Studies have shown that over-the-counter fiber supplements, such as psyllium \r\n(Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel), improve overall symptoms and bleeding from hemorrhoids.'),
(29, 'Heart Attack', 'What is Heart Attack ?\r\nA heart attack occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is severely reduced or blocked. The blockage is \r\nusually due to a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances in the heart (coronary) arteries. The \r\nfatty, cholesterol-containing deposits are called plaques. The process of plaque buildup is called \r\natherosclerosis. Sometimes, a plaque can rupture and form a clot that blocks blood flow. A lack of blood \r\nflow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. A heart attack is also called a myocardial infarction. \r\nPrompt treatment is needed for a heart attack to prevent death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAngioplasty: Special tubing with an attached deflated balloon is threaded up to the coronary arteries.\r\nAngioplasty, Laser: Similar to angioplasty except that the catheter has a laser tip that opens the blocked artery.\r\nArtificial heart valve surgery: Replaces an abnormal or diseased heart valve with a healthy one.\r\nAtherectomy: Similar to angioplasty except that the catheter has a rotating shaver on its tip to cut \r\naway plaque from the artery.\r\nBypass surgery: Treats blocked heart arteries by creating new passages for \r\nblood to flow to your heart muscle.\r\nCardiomyoplasty: An experimental procedure in which skeletal \r\nmuscles are taken from a patient’s back or abdomen. Heart transplant: Removes a diseased heart and replaces it with a donated healthy human heart.'),
(30, 'Varicose Veins', 'What is Varicose Vein ?\r\nVaricose veins are twisted, enlarged veins. Any vein that is close to the skin\'s surface (superficial) can \r\nbecome varicosed. Varicose veins most commonly affect the veins in the legs. That\'s because standing and walking increase the pressure in the veins of the lower body. For many people, varicose veins and spider veins — a common, mild variation of varicose veins — are simply a cosmetic concern. For other people, varicose veins can cause aching pain and discomfort. Sometimes varicose veins lead to more serious problems. Treatment might involve self-care measures or procedures done by a health care provider to close or remove veins.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nLarger varicose veins are generally treated with ligation and stripping, laser treatment, or radiofrequency \r\ntreatment. In some cases, a combination of treatments may work best. Smaller varicose veins and spider veins are usually treated with sclerotherapy or laser therapy on your skin.'),
(31, 'Hypothyroidism', 'What is Hypothyroidism ?\r\nHypothyroidism happens when the thyroid gland doesn\'t make enough thyroid hormone. This condition also is called underactive thyroid. Hypothyroidism may not cause noticeable symptoms in its early stages. Over time, hypothyroidism that isn\'t treated can lead to other health problems, such as high cholesterol and heart problems. Blood tests are used to diagnose hypothyroidism. Treatment with thyroid hormone medicine usually is simple, safe and effective once you and your health care provider find the right dosage for you.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAn underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is usually treated by taking daily hormone replacement tablets called levothyroxine. Levothyroxine replaces the thyroxine hormone, which your thyroid does not make enough of. You\'ll initially have regular blood tests until the correct dose of levothyroxine is reached.'),
(32, 'Hypoglycemia', 'What is Hypoglycemia ?\r\nHypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. Glucose is your body\'s main energy source. Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions many rare can cause low blood sugar in people who don\'t have diabetes. Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. But your numbers might be different. Ask your health care provider. Treatment involves \r\nquickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nIf you have hypoglycemia symptoms, do the following: Eat or drink 15 to 20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates. These are sugary foods or drinks without protein or fat that are easily converted to sugar in the body. Try glucose tablets or gel, fruit juice, regular (not diet) soda, honey, or sugary candy. The prescribed medicines can be Glucagon which is generally a hormone that raises blood glucose levels—is used to treat severe hypoglycemia. Glucagon is taken as a spray into the nose or an injection \r\nadministered under the skin.\r\n'),
(33, 'Osteoarthristis', 'What is Osteoarthristis?\r\nOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It occurs when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time. Although, osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the disorder most commonly affects joints in your hands, knees, hips and spine. Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can\'t be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nExercise is one of the most important treatments for people with osteoarthritis, whatever your age or level of fitness. Your physical activity should include a combination of exercises to strengthen your muscles and exercises to improve your general fitness. Acetaminophen. Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) has been shown to help some people with osteoarthritis who have mild to moderate pain. Taking more than the recommended dose of acetaminophen can cause liver damage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Over-the-counter NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen \r\nsodium (Aleve), taken at the recommended doses, typically relieve osteoarthritis pain. Stronger NSAIDs are available by prescription.'),
(34, 'Arthritis', 'What is Arthritis ?\r\nArthritis is the swelling and tenderness of one or more joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint \r\npain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are \r\nosteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis causes cartilage the hard, slippery tissue that \r\ncovers the ends of bones where they form a joint to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in \r\nwhich the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints. Uric acid crystals, which \r\nform when there\'s too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, \r\nsuch as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis. Treatments vary depending on the type of \r\narthritis. The main goals of arthritis treatments are to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT :\r\nNSAIDs are the most effective oral medicines for OA. They include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) naproxen \r\n(Aleve) and diclofenac (Voltaren, others). All work by blocking enzymes that cause pain and \r\nswelling. Counterirritants are some varieties of creams and ointments contain menthol or capsaicin, the \r\ningredient that makes hot peppers spicy. Rubbing these preparations on the skin over your aching joint \r\nmay interfere with the transmission of pain signals from the joint itself.'),
(35, 'Paroymsal Positional', 'What is Paroymsal Positional Vertigo (Vertigo)?\r\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is one of the most common causes of vertigo the sudden \r\nsensation that you\'re spinning or that the inside of your head is spinning. BPPV causes brief episodes of \r\nmild to intense dizziness. It is usually triggered by specific changes in your head\'s position. This might \r\noccur when you tip your head up or down, when you lie down, or when you turn over or sit up in \r\nbed. Although BPPV can be bothersome, it\'s rarely serious except when it increases the chance of falls. \r\nYou can receive effective treatment for BPPV during a doctor\'s office visit.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo may go away on its own within a few weeks or months. But, to help \r\nrelieve BPPV sooner, your doctor, audiologist or physical therapist may treat you with a series of \r\nmovements known as the canalith repositioning procedure.'),
(36, 'Acne', 'What is Acne?\r\nAcne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. \r\nIt causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects \r\npeople of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and \r\nbumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up. Depending on its severity, \r\nacne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk \r\nof such problems.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT :\r\nBenzoyl peroxide works as an antiseptic to reduce the number of bacteria on the surface of the skin. It \r\nalso helps to reduce the number of whiteheads and blackheads, and has an anti-inflammatory effect. \r\nBenzoyl peroxide is usually available as a cream or gel. It\'s used either once or twice a day. While it is \r\nadvised to consult with your doctor about dietary guidance and curating the proper beauty regimen, our \r\nexperts share that salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, and topical retinoids like adapalene are the \r\nmost effective ingredients to treat and prevent acne.\r\n'),
(37, 'Urinary Tract Infection', 'What is Urinary Tract Infection?\r\nA urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection in any part of the urinary system. The urinary system \r\nincludes the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Most infections involve the lower urinary tract the \r\nbladder and the urethra. Women are at greater risk of developing a UTI than are men. If an infection is \r\nlimited to the bladder, it can be painful and annoying. But serious health problems can result if a UTI \r\nspreads to the kidneys. Health care providers often treat urinary tract infections with antibiotics. You can \r\nalso take steps to lower the chance of getting a UTI in the first place.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nIf you have a UTI, make an appointment with a healthcare provider as soon as possible. The fastest way \r\nto feel better is by taking an antibiotic to kill the bacteria causing your infection. n cases of a complicated \r\nUTI or kidney infection, your health care provider might prescribe a fluoroquinolone medicine if there \r\nare no other treatment options. Often, UTI symptoms clear up within a few days of starting treatment. \r\nBut you may need to continue antibiotics for a week or more. Take all of the medicine as prescribed. For \r\nan uncomplicated UTI that occurs when you\'re otherwise healthy, your health care provider may \r\nrecommend a shorter course of treatment. That may mean taking an antibiotic for 1 to 3 days. Whether \r\na short course of treatment is enough to treat your infection depends on your symptoms and medical \r\nhistory. Your health care provider also may give you a pain reliever to take that can ease burning while \r\nurinating. But pain usually goes away soon after starting an antibiotic.'),
(38, 'Psoriasis', 'What is Psoriasis?\r\nPsoriasis is a skin disease that causes a rash with itchy, scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, \r\nelbows, trunk and scalp. Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It can be \r\npainful, interfere with sleep and make it hard to concentrate. The condition tends to go through cycles, \r\nflaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while. Common triggers in people with a genetic \r\npredisposition to psoriasis include infections, cuts or burns, and certain medications. Treatments are \r\navailable to help you manage symptoms. And you can try lifestyle habits and coping strategies to help \r\nyou live better with psoriasis.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nPsoriasis treatments aim to stop skin cells from growing so quickly and to remove scales. Options include \r\ncreams and ointments (topical therapy), light therapy (phototherapy), and oral or injected \r\nmedications. Which treatments you use depends on how severe the psoriasis is and how responsive it \r\nhas been to previous treatment and self-care measures. You might need to try different drugs or a \r\ncombination of treatments before you find an approach that works. Even with successful treatment, \r\nusually the disease returns. Vitamin D analogues. Synthetic forms of vitamin D such as calcipotriene \r\n(Dovonex, Sorilux) and calcitriol (Vectical) slow skin cell growth. This type of drug may be used alone or \r\nwith topical corticosteroids. Calcitriol may cause less irritation in sensitive areas. Calcipotriene and \r\ncalcitriol are usually more expensive than topical corticosteroids. Retinoids. Tazarotene (Tazorac, Avage, \r\nothers) is available as a gel or cream. It\'s applied once or twice daily.

It usually appears as reddish sores on the face, especially around the nose and \r\nmouth and on the hands and feet. Over about a week, the sores burst and develop honey-colored \r\ncrusts. Treatment with antibiotics can limit the spread of impetigo to others. Keep children home from \r\nschool or day care until they\'re no longer contagious usually 24 hours after beginning antibiotic \r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nImpetigo is treated with prescription mupirocin antibiotic ointment or cream applied directly to the \r\nsores two to three times a day for five to 10 days. Before applying the medicine, soak the area in warm \r\nwater or apply a wet cloth compress for a few minutes.'),
(40, 'Chronic Cholestasis', 'What is Chronic Cholestasis?\r\nCholestasis is the slowing or stalling of bile flow from your liver. Your liver produces bile and delivers it to your digestive system through a network of vessels called bile ducts. Bile ducts run through your liver (intrahepatic ducts) as well as outside of it (extrahepatic ducts). They connect your liver, gallbladder, pancreas and small intestine. These organs and bile ducts make up your biliary system.\r\n\r\nWhen bile can’t flow properly through your biliary system, it affects all of these organs and vessels. Bile backs up in your bile ducts and organs, irritating the tissues and interfering with their function. Bile also begins to leak into your bloodstream, which has a toxic effect. It causes uncomfortable symptoms, and eventually, illness. Cholestasis can be a temporary problem or an ongoing and worsening one.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT:\r\nAcute causes\r\n\r\nFixing cholestasis depends on fixing the underlying cause. Some causes are relatively easy to fix. Medications causing problems can be swapped for alternatives. Infections can be treated with antibiotics or antivirals. Physical obstructions can be treated by endoscopic procedures, such as ERCP. Your healthcare provider can remove blockages and open up narrowed passageways with stents.\r\n\r\nChronic causes\r\n\r\nCauses related to chronic liver diseases may be more difficult to treat. Some diseases have no known cure, and scarring of the liver tissues (cirrhosis) isn’t reversible. Lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise and avoiding alcohol, can help slow the course of many liver diseases. In the meantime, your healthcare provider will focus on treating the side effects of your condition.\r\n\r\nTreatment may include:\r\nNutrition. Dietary changes and supplements can help compensate for malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies.\r\nUrsodeoxycholic acid. This medication, which is usually used to dissolve gallstones, can sometimes help cholestasis by increasing bile production and mediating the effects of extra bile salts in your blood.\r\nNaltrexone. This opioid antagonist is sometimes prescribed to treat severe pruritus. It works by blocking the pathways to the nerves that are irritated by bile acids in your blood. Pruritus isn’t a histamine-related itch, so typical itching relief medications (antihistamines) don’t help.\r\nCholestyramine. This cholesterol medication can help bind cholesterol to bile salts in your intestines so that more comes out in your poop and less is reabsorbed into your blood. It may help with hyperlipidemia and with pruritus.\r\n');
